This is a C++ project I did in my Object Oriented Programmaing class (prog1003)

This was not a graded project. However you did need to complete this project  
to go to the exam. Reason for this not being graded, was that it was the same  
curriculum as the exam.

### How I compile it?
I use WSL/ubuntu for this, so I compile it like this: g++ -o program *.cpp
